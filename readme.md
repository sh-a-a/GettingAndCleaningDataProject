# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Project includes files *CodeBook.md* (project code book) and *run_analysis.R* which doing following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and saves it as *averages.txt*
