# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Project includes files `CodeBook.md` (project code book) and `run_analysis.R` which doing following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and saves it as `averages.txt`

## Run Project
Just clone this repo and execute in R enviroment `source('run_analysis.R')`
